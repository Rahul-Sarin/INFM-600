The steps to formulate the new dataset are as follows:

a). From the original dataset, copy all columns from psraid to Q18b and paste into a new excel sheet. 

b). Next, copy columns from Q24a to Q26 and add the columns to the new excel sheet. 

c). Finally, add the Age column to the new sheet to obtain the derived dataset. 

Note: Only the above-mentioned columns have been persisted because after careful examination of each survey questions, it was concluded that only these questions were relevant to the research; while the omitted columns did not contain content that would lend any effective contribution to the research questions.
